# To Do List
Some of these are important, and some of these are minor issues.
Currently, the list is (mostly) unsorted.

- auto-updater so that users know if a program update is available

- CSV file for plugin name aliases
  - Dragon32: i.e. allow user to specify one plugin includes one or more other plugins

- If 2 plugins have the same timestamp, force a "unsorted" state so they can be sorted.

- maybe, maybe allow mod authors to publish rules files in Data
  Files/mlox/*.txt Tricky, potential for rules filename collisions.

- compile rules files to .pkl versions when changed. and load from .pkl!

+Added by Dragon32:

- program preferences (including the download location for mlox-data.7z)

- mlox community rule editing website

- allow user to suppress any given warning.


+Added by EmperorArthur

- Automate building exe

- Clean up Documentation

- Clean up test code

- Use Python3's str.casefold instead of str.lower for caseless matching

- Fully support OpenMW

- Split utilities to their own repository (git submodule)?
  Not sure if it's worth it.
